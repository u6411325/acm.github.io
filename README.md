The design is actually very human. I don't think I need to explain some simple functionalities like this. But I just saw the message from Ajarn Chayapol and he wants us to include readme with screenshots so there you go :D


First, please choose your Major to add courses.

Selected Major wil be shown there

After selecting Major, you're ready to add courses into the table. First, go to this section

There, you can select semester, subject groups, subjects and the grade itself. I've optimized this webpage for Assumption University 64 batch so it starts from 2021/1 all the way up to 2024/2.

When you click "Add Course" button, it will get pushed into the table which looks like this

There you can see your semester, course code, course, credit and the grade you got. Whenever you added something by accident, just click the delete icon beside grade and it will get deleted.

This webpage will not accept duplicated courses since it doesn't make any sense duhh?

To reflect on your grades during your academic career, I've added a line chart (actually did that for bonus score which wasn't that hard anyways)

I also added some circular progress bars so that you can feel good or bad about your grade and see how far you've come in your bachelor degree. I've research how many credits we need in order to graduate and I've found out that it's 120 credits. That means when you reach 120 credits, the ring will close and Hurray! congrats on your shiny new bachelor degree! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

And that's it, I really hope I get full score for this :3

Please Ajarn Chayapol, if you're reading this, I spent unresonable amount of time, sweat and sleep ðŸ˜´ ðŸ˜´
